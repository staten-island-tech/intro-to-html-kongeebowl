    Hi! My name is Kaden Pang and I'm excited to learn about computer science in
    Mr. Whalen's class! I have had some prior experience in coding from both
    middle school and STEM class with Ms. Geraghty. I personally enjoy coding
    but I've only learned the basics so I hope the harder content in the future
    will be even more enjoyable and fun to do. I'm looking forward to this year
    of coding!
